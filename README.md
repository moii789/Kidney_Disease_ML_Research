Part 1: CKD Diagnostic Model
<br>
Chronic Kidney Disease is a growing global health problem that is associated with high healthcare costs and a high mortality rate. Earlier diagnosis is very important since CKD is irreversible in nature and its symptoms are difficult to detect until the later stages. Data mining techniques can aid physicians in the timely diagnosis of CKD and change the trajectory of the disease's progression. In the first phase of the study, four machine learning models - decision tree, random forest, support vector machine, artificial neural network- were used to establish CKD diagnostic models. The misclassifications made by each model were then evaluated and a hybrid model combining the random forest classifier, SVM classifier, and a Naive Bayes classifier was developed. The proposed hybrid model performed the best out of all the diagnostic models.

Part 2: Cluster Analysis of Positive Samples
In the second phase of the study, a cluster analysis was carried out to identify trends in the positively diagnosed samples and to observe whether the clusters of samples conform to the six clinical stages of CKD. K-Means Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering was implemented in conjunction with PCA, and six clean clusters were observed.
